The performer was doing a magic trick, and the crowd was mesmerized. The group of friends watched in awe as the performer made a coin disappear and reappear.\\n\\nAfter the performance, the group of friends decided to grab some lunch at a nearby caf\\u00e9. They sat down at a table and began to chat about their day so far. They talked about the magic trick they had just seen and how amazed they were by it.\\n\\nAs they were chatting, they noticed a man sitting at a table nearby who looked familiar. They couldn't quite place him, but they were sure they had seen him before. They started to stare at him, trying to figure out where they had seen him before.\\n\\nThe man noticed them staring and looked up at them. He smiled and said, \\\"Ah, you're the group of friends who were just watching the magic trick, aren't you?\\\" The group of friends were surprised and said, \\\"How did you know?\\\" The man replied, \\\"I'm the magician who just performed the trick. I'm glad you enjoyed it.\\\"\\n\\nThe group of friends were thrilled to have met the magician and asked him to join them for lunch. He agreed and they spent the rest of the day chatting and laughing together. They learned that the magician's name was Max and that he had been performing magic tricks for years.\\n\\nAs the day came to a close, the group of friends said their goodbyes to Max and thanked him for the amazing day they had just had. They left the caf\\u00e9 feeling happy and fulfilled, with memories that they would cherish for a long time.\\n\\nThe next day, the group of friends decided to go back to the city and visit Max again. They wanted to learn more about his magic tricks and how he did them. Max was happy to see them again and agreed to teach them some of his tricks.\\n\\nThe group of friends spent the day learning from Max and practicing their own magic tricks. They had a great time and were amazed by how much they had learned. They left the city feeling proud of themselves and the new skills they had acquired.\\n\\nAs they were leaving the city, they noticed a sign that said, \\\"Max's Magic Shop.\\\" They looked at each other and smiled, knowing that they had found a special place that they would always remember.

This way, the A object in b2 will be a copy of the default-constructed A object, and the destructor of A will only be called once.\\n\\nHere is an example of how you can do this:\\n\\n```\\nclass A\\n{\\npublic:\\n    A()\\n    {\\n        cout << \\\"A()\\\" << endl;\\n    }\\n\\n    A(const A& a)\\n    {\\n        cout << \\\"A(const A& a)\\\" << endl;\\n    }\\n\\n    A& operator=(const A& a)\\n    {\\n        cout << \\\"A& operator=(const A& a)\\\" << endl;\\n    }\\n\\n    ~A()\\n    {\\n        cout << \\\"~A()\\\" << endl;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nclass B\\n{\\npublic:\\n    B()\\n    {\\n        cout << \\\"B()\\\" << endl;\\n        a = A();\\n    }\\n\\n    B(const B& b)\\n    {\\n        cout << \\\"B(const B& b)\\\" << endl;\\n        a = b.a;\\n    }\\n\\n    B& operator=(const B& b)\\n    {\\n        cout << \\\"B& operator=(const B& b)\\\" << endl;\\n        a = b.a;\\n        return *this;\\n    }\\n\\n    ~B()\\n    {\\n        cout << \\\"~B()\\\" << endl;\\n    }\\n\\n    A a;\\n};\\n\\nint main()\\n{\\n    B b1;\\n    B b2 = b1;\\n\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe output of this code will be:\\n\\n```\\nA()\\nB()\\nB(const B& b)\\n~A()\\n~B()\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, the destructor of A is only called once.\",\n",

This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet.\\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10 1.988 1.644 33.2\\npUC19 1.866 1.211 17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.\\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material 2 µL 10 µL\\nFast digest buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water 30 µL 22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\ngel electrophoresis\\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230 0.826\\nA260/A280 1.609\\nng/ µL 12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\nBefore clean up After clean up\\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\\nng/ µL 28.1 109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ µL 109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material 4 µL 5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade water 28 µL 27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light. This is the seconds gel that contained new digestion reaction containing the genomic DNA after clean up. The gel was prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM along with 6X loading dye used for sample preparations. Gel was shared with another group (Mahan’s) which is represented with the arrow head and samples in lane 1,2,3 belongs to other group.

This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet.\\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10 1.988 1.644 33.2\\npUC19 1.866 1.211 17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.\\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material 2 µL 10 µL\\nFast digest buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water 30 µL 22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\ngel electrophoresis\\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230 0.826\\nA260/A280 1.609\\nng/ µL 12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\nBefore clean up After clean up\\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\\nng/ µL 28.1 109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ µL 109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material 4 µL 5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade water 28 µL 27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.\\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material 2 µL 10 µL\\nFast digest buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water 30 µL 22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230 0.826\\nA260/A280 1.609\\nng/ µL 12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\nBefore clean up After clean up\\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\\nng/ µL 28.1 109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material 2 µL 10 µL\\nFast digest buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water 30 µL 22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\ngel electrophoresis\\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230 0.826\\nA260/A280 1.609\\nng/ µL 12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\nBefore clean up After clean up\\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\\nng/ µL 28.1 109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank.

Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ µL 109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material 4 µL 5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade water 28 µL 27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet.\\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10 1.988 1.644 33.2\\npUC19 1.866 1.211 17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.\\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material 2 µL 10 µL\\nFast digest buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water 30 µL 22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\ngel electrophoresis\\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230 0.826\\nA260/A280 1.609\\nng/ µL 12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\nBefore clean up After clean up\\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\\nng/ µL 28.1 109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ µL 109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material 4 µL 5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade water 28 µL 27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.\\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material 2 µL 10 µL\\nFast digest buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water 30 µL 22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230 0.826\\nA260/A280 1.609\\nng/ µL 12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\nBefore clean up After clean up\\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\\nng/ µL 28.1 109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material 2 µL 10 µL\\nFast digest buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water 30 µL 22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material 2 µL 10 µL\\nFast digest buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water 30 µL 22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\ngel electrophoresis\\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230 0.826\\nA260/A280 1.609\\nng/ µL 12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\nBefore clean up After clean up\\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\\nng/ µL 28.1 109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank.

Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ µL 109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material 4 µL 5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade water 28 µL 27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet.\\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10 1.988 1.644 33.2\\npUC19 1.866 1.211 17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.\\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material 2 µL 10 µL\\nFast digest buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water 30 µL 22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\ngel electrophoresis\\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230 0.826\\nA260/A280 1.609\\nng/ µL 12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\nBefore clean up After clean up\\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\\nng/ µL 28.1 109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ µL 109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material 4 µL 5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer 2 µL 2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 µL 1 µL\\nPCR Grade water 28 µL 27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 35 µL 35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )= x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x\\n\\n5= 6x-x\\n5= 5x\\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 µL\\nT4 Ligase 2 µL\\nPEG4000 2 µL\\nPCR Grade water 10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume 25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\\nReagents 50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19 50 µL of competent cells 50\\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

This new genomic DNA was cleaned up using the same protocol, but with a modification to increase the elution volume, which resulted in a much higher final concentration of 109.6 ng/μL.\\n\\nThe second gel electrophoresis, using the cleaned-up genomic DNA, was successful in visualizing the digestion products. The uncut genomic DNA showed a large band, while the BamHI-digested genomic DNA exhibited a smear, indicating that the digestion was complete. The digested plasmid pUC19 also showed two faint bands, as expected.\\n\\nThe ligation of the digested genomic DNA and plasmid was then performed, and the ligated product was used to transform competent Mach 01 E. coli cells. However, the transformation experiments were unsuccessful, with both the positive control and the experimental plates showing contamination.\\n\\nThe failure of the transformation experiments could be due to several factors, such as issues with the competent cells, the ligation reaction, or the plating procedure. It is also possible that the genomic library was not successfully created, and the ligated product did not contain the desired insert.\\n\\nOverall, the researchers were able to successfully isolate and clean up the genomic DNA, as well as confirm the digestion of both the genomic DNA and the plasmid. However, the subsequent steps of ligation and transformation were not successful, preventing the creation of the desired genomic library. Further optimization of the protocols and troubleshooting of the transformation process would be necessary to achieve the final goal.', 'time_sec': 6.529644012451172}\n",

However, the results were not as expected, with no bands visible on the gel. This led to the decision to perform a DNA clean-up for the genomic DNA in order to concentrate it more.

Another gel electrophoresis was performed, and the results were analyzed using BIOrad software. The gel showed a large smear in the genomic DNA sample, indicating that the digestion was successful. However, the plasmid DNA sample showed two very faint bands, indicating that the digestion was not as successful as in the genomic DNA sample.\\n\\nThe final step in the process was to ligate the insert (digested genomic DNA) and vector (digested pUC19) using T4 ligase. The ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 \\u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \\u00b0C for 10 minutes.

The digestion reactions were incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n\\nIn order to confirm the success of the digestion, gel electrophoresis was performed. However, the results were not as expected, with no bands visible on the gel. This led to the decision to perform a DNA clean-up for the genomic DNA in order to concentrate it more. The genomic DNA was cleaned up using the GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit, with a modification of using 15 µL of Elution Buffer instead of 10 µL. The concentration of the genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean-up, which came out to be significantly low (0.012 µg/µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/µL.\\n\\nA new vial of isolated genomic DNA was provided by the lab instructor, and the concentration was analyzed on SimpliNano, which came out to be 28.1 ng/µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean-up kit with the same modification of 15 µL elution buffer. After clean-up, the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and was found to be 109.6 ng/µL.\\n\\nA new digestion reaction was set up with the cleaned-up genomic DNA, and the reaction was incubated for half an hour in a 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. Another gel electrophoresis was performed, and the results were analyzed using BIOrad software. The gel showed a large smear in the genomic DNA sample, indicating that the digestion was successful. However, the plasmid DNA sample showed two very faint bands, indicating that the digestion was not as successful as in the genomic DNA sample.\\n\\nThe final step in the process was to ligate the insert (digested genomic DNA) and vector (digested pUC19) using T4 ligase. The ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\n\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed using Mach 01 strain competent cells. The goal was to plate one positive control, one negative control, and one experimental in duplicates. However, the transformation failed due to contamination in the positive control. A second transformation was performed, but it also failed due to contamination.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the project did not achieve its intended goal of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19 using BamHI restriction enzyme. The digestion of genomic DNA was successful, but the digestion of plasmid DNA was not as successful. The ligation of the insert and vector was successful, but the transformation failed due to contamination.

The successful digestion of genomic DNA and plasmid suggests that the protocol for restriction enzyme digestion was effective, and the presence of the *rspL* gene in the genomic DNA of *E. coli* Top10 can be confirmed. Future experiments should focus on optimizing the transformation procedure, ensuring sterile conditions, and exploring alternative competent cell strains to improve the success rate of the experiment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the transformation results were inconclusive due to contamination, the successful digestion and gel electrophoresis results provide a foundation for further investigation into the creation of a genomic library and the presence of the *rspL* gene in *E. coli* Top10.', 'time_sec': 18.93628764152527}\n",

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer.

To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours.

The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples.

The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye.

The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye.

The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples.

The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively.

The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye.

To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively.

When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples.

To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours.

The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

      "2024-08-27 20:18:23,116 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'mixtral-8x7b', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates.

      "2024-08-27 20:18:23,118 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'mistral-large', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

The gel was prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM along with 6X loading dye used for sample preparations. Gel was shared with another group (Mahan’s) which is represented with the arrow head and samples in lane 1,2,3 belongs to other group.

After recovery, cells were spun down for 5 minutes at 5000 x g and 200 µL of it was thrown. 150 µL of cells were spread onto the plates using Pasteur pipette. Bunsen burner was used to maintain a sterile environment.

This was due to the dilution of the genomic DNA during the digestion reaction and the loading of the sample onto the gel. The study also faced contamination in the positive control, which resulted in the failure of the transformation reaction. The study also had limitations in terms of the efficiency of the transformation reaction, which was affected by the inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism.\\n\\nFuture directions:\\nThe study could be improved by optimizing the concentration of genomic DNA and the digestion reaction to ensure successful results. The study could also be improved by using a different enzyme or a different method to create the genomic library. The study could also be improved by optimizing the transformation reaction to ensure efficient uptake of DNA by the host organism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIn conclusion, the project aimed to create a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E. coli top10 as the genomic DNA and pUC19 plasmid as the vector. Although the project faced some challenges, including low concentration of genomic DNA and contamination in the positive control, the results showed that the digestion reaction was successful and the genomic library was created. The project also demonstrated the importance of proper sample preparation and handling to ensure successful results.

The two faint bands for the cut plasmid DNA in the second and third gel electrophoresis suggest that the plasmid DNA was not fully digested either.\\n\\nTo troubleshoot the issue, a DNA clean-up was performed for the genomic DNA to concentrate it more. However, the clean-up resulted in the loss of the DNA, and the concentration was significantly low (0.012 µg/µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/µL.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the genomic library was not successfully created due to the unsuccessful digestion of the genomic DNA and plasmid DNA. The low concentration of the genomic DNA and the unsuccessful digestion of the plasmid DNA may have contributed to the failure of the project. To improve the results, it is recommended to repeat the digestion process with a higher concentration of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA, and to optimize the digestion conditions. Additionally, it is recommended to perform a DNA clean-up before the digestion process to ensure that the DNA is of high quality and concentration.', 'time_sec': 15.574537992477417}\n",

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

      "2024-08-27 20:19:04,353 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'gpt-4', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples.

The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted.

      "2024-08-27 20:19:04,354 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'haiku', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye.

This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye.

To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

      "2024-08-27 20:19:04,358 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'llama3-8b', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples.

This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye.

To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively.

      "2024-08-27 20:19:04,361 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'mixtral-8x7b', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates.

      "2024-08-27 20:19:04,362 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'mistral-large', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

      "  \"text\": \"### Discussion\\n\\nThe primary objective of this experiment was to create a genomic library using a streptomycin-resistant strain of E. coli Top10 and incorporate the rspL gene into the pUC19 plasmid vector. The process involved several key steps: isolation of genomic and plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, gel electrophoresis, ligation, and transformation. Despite the detailed planning and execution, the experiment faced several challenges that impacted the final results.\\n\\n#### Isolation and Concentration of Genomic and Plasmid DNA\\n\\nThe initial isolation of genomic DNA from E. coli Top10 and plasmid DNA from pUC19 was successful, as indicated by the concentration values obtained using SimpliNano. However, the concentration of the isolated genomic DNA (33.2 ng/\\u00b5L) was relatively low, which posed a problem for subsequent steps, particularly gel electrophoresis. The low concentration of DNA was insufficient for visualization using INtRON RedSafeTM, which requires a minimum concentration of 50 ng/\\u00b5L.\\n\\n#### Restriction Enzyme Digestion and Gel Electrophoresis\\n\\nThe initial plan to use HindIII for restriction enzyme digestion was altered to BamHI to test its efficacy on the Top10 strain, similar to its action on the K12 strain. The first gel electrophoresis did not show any bands, indicating that the digestion was unsuccessful, likely due to the low concentration of genomic DNA. This necessitated a DNA clean-up step to concentrate the genomic DNA further. The cleaned-up genomic DNA provided by Vanessa had a significantly higher concentration (109.6 ng/\\u00b5L), which improved the results in the subsequent gel electrophoresis. The second gel electrophoresis showed a large smear for the cut genomic DNA, indicating successful digestion by BamHI.\\n\\n#### Ligation and Transformation\\n\\nThe ligation step aimed to combine the digested genomic DNA with the pUC19 plasmid vector. Despite following the protocol meticulously, the transformation step did not yield the expected results.

The process involved several key steps: isolation of genomic and plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, gel electrophoresis, ligation, and transformation. Despite the detailed planning and execution, the experiment faced several challenges that impacted the final results.\\n\\n#### Isolation and Concentration of Genomic and Plasmid DNA\\n\\nThe initial isolation of genomic DNA from E. coli Top10 and plasmid DNA from pUC19 was successful, as indicated by the concentration values obtained using SimpliNano. However, the concentration of the isolated genomic DNA (33.2 ng/µL) was relatively low, which posed a problem for subsequent steps, particularly gel electrophoresis. The low concentration of DNA was insufficient for visualization using INtRON RedSafeTM, which requires a minimum concentration of 50 ng/µL.\\n\\n#### Restriction Enzyme Digestion and Gel Electrophoresis\\n\\nThe initial plan to use HindIII for restriction enzyme digestion was altered to BamHI to test its efficacy on the Top10 strain, similar to its action on the K12 strain. The first gel electrophoresis did not show any bands, indicating that the digestion was unsuccessful, likely due to the low concentration of genomic DNA. This necessitated a DNA clean-up step to concentrate the genomic DNA further. The cleaned-up genomic DNA provided by Vanessa had a significantly higher concentration (109.6 ng/µL), which improved the results in the subsequent gel electrophoresis. The second gel electrophoresis showed a large smear for the cut genomic DNA, indicating successful digestion by BamHI.\\n\\n#### Ligation and Transformation\\n\\nThe ligation step aimed to combine the digested genomic DNA with the pUC19 plasmid vector. Despite following the protocol meticulously, the transformation step did not yield the expected results. The positive control showed contamination, and the experimental plates did not show efficient transformation, as indicated by the absence of white colonies on the Ampicillin/X-gal/IPTG plates. This suggests that the ligation or transformation process was inefficient.\\n\\n#### Troubleshooting and Optimization\\n\\n1. **DNA Concentration**: Ensuring a higher initial concentration of genomic DNA is crucial.

Isolation of Genomic DNA and Plasmid DNA:\\nThe initial concentrations of the isolated genomic DNA (Top10) and plasmid DNA (pUC19) were 33.2 ng/\\u00b5L and 17.2 ng/\\u00b5L, respectively. These concentrations were relatively low, which could have contributed to the difficulties encountered during subsequent steps.\\n\\n2. Restriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nThe decision to use BamHI instead of HindIII for the initial digestion was made to investigate whether BamHI would show similar digestion patterns with the Top10 strain as it did with the K12 strain. However, the gel electrophoresis results after the first digestion did not show any bands, likely due to the low concentration of the genomic DNA.\\n\\n3. DNA Clean-up:\\nThe DNA clean-up step was introduced to concentrate the genomic DNA, but it resulted in a significant loss of DNA, with the concentration dropping from 33.2 ng/\\u00b5L to 0.012 \\u00b5g/\\u00b5L (12 ng/\\u00b5L). This loss necessitated the use of a new genomic DNA sample provided by the lab instructor.\\n\\n4. Subsequent Digestion and Gel Electrophoresis:\\nAfter cleaning up the new genomic DNA sample, the digestion with BamHI and gel electrophoresis showed a smear for the digested genomic DNA, indicating successful digestion. The uncut genomic DNA showed a distinct band, while the digested plasmid DNA showed faint bands, suggesting partial digestion.\\n\\n5. Ligation and Transformation:\\nThe ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio of the digested genomic DNA (insert) and digested plasmid DNA (vector). However, the transformation experiments were unsuccessful due to potential issues with plating or inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism.\\n\\n6. Additional Digestion with HindIII:\\nTo improve the chances of incorporating the rspL gene into the plasmid, a double digestion with BamHI and HindIII was performed. The gel electrophoresis results showed distinct bands for the undigested genomic DNA and plasmid DNA, as well as smears for the digested samples, indicating successful digestion.\\n\\nTroubleshooting and Optimization:\\n\\n1. Increase Genomic DNA Concentration:\\nTo ensure sufficient DNA concentration for downstream applications, it is recommended to optimize the genomic DNA isolation protocol or consider alternative methods, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, to obtain higher yields.\\n\\n2. Optimize Restriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nPerform a time-course digestion to determine the optimal incubation time for complete digestion of both the genomic DNA and plasmid DNA. Additionally, consider using alternative restriction enzymes that may provide more specific and efficient digestion.\\n\\n3. Improve DNA Clean-up Efficiency:\\nEvaluate different DNA clean-up kits or protocols to minimize DNA loss during the clean-up process. Alternatively, consider using the digested DNA directly for ligation without a clean-up step, if the concentration is sufficient.\\n\\n4. Optimize Ligation Conditions:\\nExperiment with different insert-to-vector ratios and ligation reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, incubation time) to improve the ligation efficiency. Additionally, consider using a ligation control to verify the ligation reaction's success.\\n\\n5. Optimize Transformation Conditions:\\nEnsure proper handling and preparation of competent cells to maximize transformation efficiency. Factors such as heat shock duration, recovery time, and plating conditions can significantly impact transformation success.\\n\\n6.

Isolation of Genomic DNA and Plasmid DNA:\\nThe initial concentrations of the isolated genomic DNA (Top10) and plasmid DNA (pUC19) were 33.2 ng/µL and 17.2 ng/µL, respectively. These concentrations were relatively low, which could have contributed to the difficulties encountered during subsequent steps.\\n\\n2. Restriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nThe decision to use BamHI instead of HindIII for the initial digestion was made to investigate whether BamHI would show similar digestion patterns with the Top10 strain as it did with the K12 strain. However, the gel electrophoresis results after the first digestion did not show any bands, likely due to the low concentration of the genomic DNA.\\n\\n3. DNA Clean-up:\\nThe DNA clean-up step was introduced to concentrate the genomic DNA, but it resulted in a significant loss of DNA, with the concentration dropping from 33.2 ng/µL to 0.012 µg/µL (12 ng/µL). This loss necessitated the use of a new genomic DNA sample provided by the lab instructor.\\n\\n4. Subsequent Digestion and Gel Electrophoresis:\\nAfter cleaning up the new genomic DNA sample, the digestion with BamHI and gel electrophoresis showed a smear for the digested genomic DNA, indicating successful digestion. The uncut genomic DNA showed a distinct band, while the digested plasmid DNA showed faint bands, suggesting partial digestion.\\n\\n5. Ligation and Transformation:\\nThe ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio of the digested genomic DNA (insert) and digested plasmid DNA (vector). However, the transformation experiments were unsuccessful due to potential issues with plating or inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism.\\n\\n6. Additional Digestion with HindIII:\\nTo improve the chances of incorporating the rspL gene into the plasmid, a double digestion with BamHI and HindIII was performed. The gel electrophoresis results showed distinct bands for the undigested genomic DNA and plasmid DNA, as well as smears for the digested samples, indicating successful digestion.\\n\\nTroubleshooting and Optimization:\\n\\n1. Increase Genomic DNA Concentration:\\nTo ensure sufficient DNA concentration for downstream applications, it is recommended to optimize the genomic DNA isolation protocol or consider alternative methods, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, to obtain higher yields.\\n\\n2. Optimize Restriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nPerform a time-course digestion to determine the optimal incubation time for complete digestion of both the genomic DNA and plasmid DNA. Additionally, consider using alternative restriction enzymes that may provide more specific and efficient digestion.\\n\\n3. Improve DNA Clean-up Efficiency:\\nEvaluate different DNA clean-up kits or protocols to minimize DNA loss during the clean-up process. Alternatively, consider using the digested DNA directly for ligation without a clean-up step, if the concentration is sufficient.\\n\\n4. Optimize Ligation Conditions:\\nExperiment with different insert-to-vector ratios and ligation reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, incubation time) to improve the ligation efficiency. Additionally, consider using a ligation control to verify the ligation reaction's success.\\n\\n5. Optimize Transformation Conditions:\\nEnsure proper handling and preparation of competent cells to maximize transformation efficiency. Factors such as heat shock duration, recovery time, and plating conditions can significantly impact transformation success.\\n\\n6. Confirm Presence of rspL Gene:\\nPerform colony PCR or sequencing on the transformed colonies to confirm the presence and correct insertion of the rspL gene in the plasmid vector.\\n\\n7. Consider Alternative Cloning Strategies:\\nIf the traditional cloning approach continues to be challenging, explore alternative cloning strategies, such as Gibson assembly or CRISPR-based methods, which may provide more efficient and streamlined workflows.\\n\\nBy addressing these troubleshooting and optimization suggestions, the chances of successfully creating a genomic library with the rspL gene incorporated into the plasmid vector can be improved.\", 'time_sec': 19.62545347213745}\n",

The concentrations of the isolated DNA were determined using a SimpliNano spectrophotometer, with the genomic DNA concentration being 33.2 ng/\\u00b5L and the plasmid DNA concentration being 17.2 ng/\\u00b5L.

A new digestion reaction was set up with the cleaned-up genomic DNA, and a second gel electrophoresis was performed. This time, the gel showed the expected bands for the uncut and cut genomic DNA, indicating successful digestion by BamHI. The plasmid DNA digested with BamHI also showed two faint bands, suggesting incomplete digestion.\\n\\nThe ligation reaction was then set up with a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic DNA, using T4 ligase and PEG4000. The reaction was incubated overnight at 4\\u00b0C and subsequently heat-inactivated at 65\\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells, with positive and negative controls included for validation. The transformation reactions were plated on ampicillin/X-gal/IPTG plates, and the plates were incubated at 35\\u00b0C for 24 hours.\\n\\nThe transformation results, however, were not successful. The positive control showed contamination, indicating an issue with the plating procedure or the competence of the cells. Additionally, there was inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, leading to unsuccessful transformation.\\n\\nTo further optimize the experiment, a third gel electrophoresis was performed using both HindIII and BamHI enzymes. The restriction analyzer provided valuable information about the cutting positions of these enzymes on the genomic and plasmid DNA.

However, throughout the course of this project, several problems were encountered, and adjustments had to be made, as detailed in the methods and results sections.\\n\\nThe first major issue encountered in the project was the inability to visualize bands after performing the first gel electrophoresis after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI. A major contributing factor to this problem was the low concentration of the genomic DNA. At 33.2 ng/µL, this concentration was lower than the detection limit of the RedSafeTM dye used for visualization. Moreover, the omission of uncut genomic DNA and cut plasmid DNA from electrophoresis made it difficult to assess the digestion process through a visual comparison. This insight highlighted the need for a more careful approach in terms of sample preparation and loading, as well as the importance of an optimal DNA concentration for successful gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nTo address the issue of low DNA concentration, a DNA clean-up step was performed using a GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean-up kit. However, the process resulted in a substantial loss of DNA, lowering its concentration to 12 ng/µL. This outcome led to the provision of a new genomic DNA sample with a higher initial concentration of 28.1 ng/µL. Following clean-up with the same kit, this sample’s concentration increased to 109.6 ng/µL, which was considered suitable for further experimentation. The effective DNA cleanup of genomic DNA played a crucial role in ensuring a better DNA resolution on the gel after digestion.\\n\\nBased on the significantly higher DNA concentration, a second gel electrophoresis was performed. The results indicated a successful digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI, as evidenced by a smear for the cut genomic DNA when compared against uncut genomic DNA.

This involves a deeper dive into each step of the process, identifying potential pitfalls, and providing specific solutions or alternatives to overcome these challenges. Here are detailed troubleshooting strategies for each critical step:\\n\\n### 1. **Optimizing DNA Concentration and Quality**\\n\\n- **Quantification and Quality Assessment**: Utilize more sensitive quantification methods such as Qubit fluorometric quantification for more accurate DNA concentration measurements. Assess DNA quality using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer to obtain A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios, ensuring they are within the ideal range (1.8-2.0 for A260/A280 and 2.0-2.2 for A260/A230).\\n  \\n- **DNA Concentration**: If DNA concentration is too low, consider using a more concentrated elution buffer or a smaller elution volume during the DNA clean-up step. Alternatively, perform additional rounds of DNA extraction from a larger starting volume of bacterial culture to increase yield.\\n\\n### 2. **Improving Gel Electrophoresis Results**\\n\\n- **Sample Preparation**: Ensure that the DNA is fully dissolved in the loading buffer. Heating the samples at 55-60\\u00b0C for a few minutes before loading onto the gel can help in this regard.\\n\\n- **Gel Preparation and Running Conditions**: Verify the agarose gel concentration is appropriate for the size of the DNA fragments expected (0.7% - 1% for larger fragments, 1.5% - 2% for smaller fragments). Ensure the gel is fully polymerized before use. Adjust the voltage to run the gel slower if resolution is an issue, as running the gel at too high a voltage can cause smearing.\\n\\n- **Visualization**: If the dye used for visualization is not sensitive enough, consider using more sensitive alternatives like SYBR Safe or ethidium bromide (with appropriate safety measures). Additionally, ensure the gel documentation system is properly calibrated for the dye being used.\\n\\n### 3. **Optimizing Ligation and Transformation**\\n\\n- **Ligation Efficiency**: Increase the ligation efficiency by optimizing the molar ratio of insert to vector, typically starting with a 3:1 ratio and adjusting as necessary. Ensure the ligation reaction is incubated under optimal conditions recommended by the enzyme manufacturer.\\n\\n- **Transformation Efficiency**: Increase transformation efficiency by ensuring competent cells are kept on ice at all times until heat shock and are as fresh as possible. Optimize the heat shock time and temperature (usually 42\\u00b0C for 30-60 seconds) for the specific strain of competent cells used. After heat shock, immediately return the cells to ice for 2 minutes to stabilize the cell membranes.\\n\\n- **Post-Transformation Recovery**: Extend the recovery period post-transformation to allow more time for the bacteria to express the antibiotic resistance marker before plating on selective media. This can range from 1 to 2 hours at 37\\u00b0C with gentle shaking.\\n\\n### 4. **Addressing Contamination and Inefficient DNA Uptake**\\n\\n- **Sterile Technique**: Reinforce strict adherence to sterile techniques to avoid contamination. Use freshly autoclaved or sterile-filtered solutions, and work in a laminar flow hood if possible.\\n\\n- **Plasmid Design and Selection**: Ensure the plasmid vector and the insert have compatible ends for ligation, and that the vector has not self-ligated. This can be achieved by dephosphorylating the vector ends to prevent self-ligation.\\n\\n- **Positive and Negative Controls**: Always include positive and negative controls in transformation experiments to help diagnose issues. A positive control (e.g., a plasmid with a known insert) confirms the transformation system works, while a negative control (e.g., competent cells without DNA) ensures the antibiotics and other reagents are effective.\\n\\nBy implementing these detailed troubleshooting strategies, the chances of successfully creating a genomic library with the desired characteristics are significantly improved.

      "  \"text\": \"Here is a more detailed troubleshooting guide for the issues encountered in your experiment:\\n\\n**Issue 1: Inability to Visualize Bands After Gel Electrophoresis of Digested Genomic DNA**\\n- **Problem**: The concentration of genomic DNA was too low (33.2 ng/\\u00b5L) to be detected by the RedSafeTM dye. Omission of crucial samples (uncut genomic DNA and cut plasmid DNA) from the gel made it difficult to assess digestion efficiency.\\n- **Solution**: \\n   - **DNA Concentration**: Ensure that the genomic DNA concentration is within an acceptable range for detection by your gel dye. A concentration above the detection limit of the dye is ideal. You can concentrate your DNA sample or perform DNA amplification if the concentration is too low. \\n   - **Sample Preparation**: Always include uncut and cut versions of both genomic DNA and plasmid DNA on the gel to allow for visual comparison and assessment of digestion efficiency. Prepare enough samples to ensure that you have sufficient volumes for loading and that the DNA concentration is within the detectable range.\\n\\n**Issue 2: Low DNA Concentration After Clean-Up**\\n- **Problem**: The DNA clean-up step using the GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean-up kit resulted in a substantial loss of DNA, lowering the concentration to 12 ng/\\u00b5L.\\n- **Solution**: \\n   - **DNA Clean-up Kit**: Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully when using a DNA clean-up kit. Optimize the clean-up protocol by adjusting parameters such as binding conditions, wash steps, and elution volume to maximize DNA yield while maintaining purity. \\n   - **Starting Material**: Start with a higher concentration of genomic DNA for the clean-up step. You can concentrate your DNA sample or use a sample with a higher initial concentration. In your case, you obtained better results with a starting concentration of 28.1 ng/\\u00b5L.\\n\\n**Issue 3: Inefficient Digestion of Plasmid DNA**\\n- **Problem**: Faint bands were observed for the cut plasmid DNA on the gel electrophoresis, indicating potential inefficient digestion or problems with gel preparation/electrophoresis conditions.\\n- **Solution**: \\n   - **Digestion Conditions**: Optimize the digestion conditions by adjusting parameters such as enzyme-to-DNA ratio, incubation time, and temperature. Ensure that the reaction conditions are favorable for the restriction enzyme's activity. \\n   - **Gel Conditions**: Optimize the gel conditions, including agarose concentration, buffer composition, and voltage, to improve band resolution. Ensure that the gel is prepared correctly and that the electrophoresis conditions are consistent. \\n\\n**Issue 4: Transformation Concerns**\\n- **Problem**: Both transformation attempts raised concerns.

Omission of crucial samples (uncut genomic DNA and cut plasmid DNA) from the gel made it difficult to assess digestion efficiency.\\n- **Solution**: \\n   - **DNA Concentration**: Ensure that the genomic DNA concentration is within an acceptable range for detection by your gel dye. A concentration above the detection limit of the dye is ideal. You can concentrate your DNA sample or perform DNA amplification if the concentration is too low. \\n   - **Sample Preparation**: Always include uncut and cut versions of both genomic DNA and plasmid DNA on the gel to allow for visual comparison and assessment of digestion efficiency. Prepare enough samples to ensure that you have sufficient volumes for loading and that the DNA concentration is within the detectable range.\\n\\n**Issue 2: Low DNA Concentration After Clean-Up**\\n- **Problem**: The DNA clean-up step using the GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean-up kit resulted in a substantial loss of DNA, lowering the concentration to 12 ng/µL.\\n- **Solution**: \\n   - **DNA Clean-up Kit**: Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully when using a DNA clean-up kit. Optimize the clean-up protocol by adjusting parameters such as binding conditions, wash steps, and elution volume to maximize DNA yield while maintaining purity. \\n   - **Starting Material**: Start with a higher concentration of genomic DNA for the clean-up step. You can concentrate your DNA sample or use a sample with a higher initial concentration. In your case, you obtained better results with a starting concentration of 28.1 ng/µL.\\n\\n**Issue 3: Inefficient Digestion of Plasmid DNA**\\n- **Problem**: Faint bands were observed for the cut plasmid DNA on the gel electrophoresis, indicating potential inefficient digestion or problems with gel preparation/electrophoresis conditions.\\n- **Solution**: \\n   - **Digestion Conditions**: Optimize the digestion conditions by adjusting parameters such as enzyme-to-DNA ratio, incubation time, and temperature. Ensure that the reaction conditions are favorable for the restriction enzyme's activity. \\n   - **Gel Conditions**: Optimize the gel conditions, including agarose concentration, buffer composition, and voltage, to improve band resolution.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye.

To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively.

Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted.

      "2024-08-27 20:21:02,526 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'sonnet5', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa.

Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates.

This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer.

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI.

To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates.

The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

      "2024-08-27 20:21:02,531 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'basic', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful.

Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230).

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each.

The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL.

Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

      "2024-08-27 20:21:02,535 - INFO - Sending request to https://llms.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com/ with payload: {'model': 'llama2-13b', 'data': 'Background information\\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin resistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp)  as the genomic DNA which will be  incorporated into puc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document. To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc. (ng/µL)\\nTop10\\t1.988\\t1.644\\t33.2\\npUC19\\t1.866\\t1.211\\t17.2\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on Feb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were incubated in 37 °C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes.\\n gel electrophoresis\\n This gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion was successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided by lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230). This genomic DNA was then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15  µL elution buffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table below.\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\\n\\tBefore clean up\\tAfter clean up\\nA260/A280\\t1.598\\t1.794\\nA260/A230\\t1.143\\t2.188\\nng/ µL\\t28.1\\t109.6\\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA provided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 µL and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher concentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\\n\\tpUC19\\tTop10 genomic DNA\\nConcentration\\t17.2 ng/ µL\\t109.6 ng/ µL\\nGenomic material\\t4 µL\\t5 µL\\nFast Digest Buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t28 µL\\t27 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both genetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively.

Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230).

Both reactions were incubated for half an hour in 37 °C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 minutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was ready.\\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared that is 500 mg Agarose in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer along with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization. Same 1Kb DNA ladder was used as standard with 6X loading dye. This time since the concentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 µL of cut and uncut genomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded. \\n6X loading dye sample calculation:\\n1/(6 )=  x/(x+5)\\nx+5= 6x \\n                                                                          \\n5= 6x-x \\n5= 5x \\nx=1 µL , where x is the amount of loading dye added to the sample.\\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut genomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by Mahan’s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first visualized under UV light and then under BIOrad software which will be added in result section.\\nLigation with only one reaction:\\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the following week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic top10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000. \\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\\nReaction reagents\\tLigation ratio (1:1)\\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA)\\t3 µL\\nVector (digested pUC19)\\t3 µL\\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X)\\t5 µL\\nT4 Ligase\\t2 µL\\nPEG4000\\t2 µL\\nPCR Grade water\\t10 µL\\nTotal reaction volume\\t25 µL\\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction enzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 °C for 10 minutes. The ligated product was then stored at -20 °C until transformation.\\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To proceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 µL each) were provided by Vanessa along with 4 agar plates.\\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one experimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent cells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\\nTable 7 : Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\\nReaction\\tPositive control\\tNegative control\\tExperimental\\nReagents\\t50 µL competent cells + 10 µL pUC19\\t50 µL of competent cells \\t50 \\n\\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered. Meanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread with 100 µL of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 µL of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 µL of 500 mM IPTG per plate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was introduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 µL onto plates, 150 µL was plated for each. This was done because in part A the positive control did not show TNTC which means.\\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 ° C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from incubator the next day (March 25, 2023). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: \\n\\nFirst gel electrophoresis.\\n\\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for 1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 µL loaded as standard whilst the well labelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 µL digested sample  + 2 µL loading dye). The above gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded which was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low concentration of genomic DNA.\\n\\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM  requires at minimum 50 ng/ µL of the sample concentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was unsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was already quite low with 33.2 ng/ µL and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume of 35 µL we used 10 µL of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted. As per this, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ µL which is very less than 50 ng/ µL as per the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\\n(33.2 ng / µL × 10 µL in digestion) / (10 µL while loading) = 33.2 ng/ µL\\nHence, nothing was detected.\\nFurthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10 was not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\\n\\nThis resulted in cleaning up the genomic DNA to get better concentration numbers and then perform digestion and gel electrophoresis for confirming the presence of rspL gene and action of BamHI. Another gel electrophoresis was performed with new genomic DNA provided by Vanessa followed by its clean up since the originally isolated genomic DNA was lost in clean up procedures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes at 120 V under UV light.

Not only this when we loaded 10 µL digested sample with 2 µL loading dye it further diluted.

To achieve this our pair (Jetul and Japneet) firstly isolated the DNA from genomic stain and plasmid using specific isolation kits included in method section. Followed by restriction enzyme digestion with suitable enzyme prior to ligation. The plan then included functional selection based on streptomycin resistance which will confirm successful insertion of rspL gene in the recipient E.coli strain Mach1, the competent cells used for transformation.\\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) served as the genomic strain that will be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp) utilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically competent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product will be plated on ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto streptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property. \\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior to ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however, throughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be thoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the mistakes.\\n\\nMethods/Materials\\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid pUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET genomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)  respectively. This task was completed in pair, genomic DNA isolated by Jetul and pUC19 by Japneet. \\nConcentration of both genomic and plasmid pUC19 were determined using SimpliNano which are summarized in the table below.\\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\\nGenomic material\\tA260/A280\\tA260/A230\\tDNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 µL for both DNA. Elution buffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on SimpliNano.  \\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI will show the same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E. coli as it was the case with K12 strain.\\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the reagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\\nDigestion Reagents\\tpUC19\\tTop10 (rspL gene)\\nGenetic material\\t2 µL\\t10 µL\\nFast digest buffer\\t2 µL\\t2 µL\\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme)\\t1 µL\\t1 µL\\nPCR Grade Water\\t30 µL\\t22 µL\\nTotal Reaction volume \\t35 µL\\t35 µL\\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic materials used to create the genomic library.

To prepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg Agarose powder in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 µL INtRON RedSafeTM for visualization.\\n1Kb DNA ladder was used as a standard with 6X loading dye. 10 µL of digested genomic was loaded into the gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light, there were no bands visible.\\nDNA clean-up:\\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab instructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using “Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit” the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was introduced in original clean up protocol which stated “10 µL of Elution buffer” to elute which was updated to “15 µL of Elution Buffer”. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on SimpliNano after clean up which came out to be significantly low ( 0.012 µg/ µL) as compared to earlier 33.2 ng/ µL. This indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\\n\\tCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\\nA260/A230\\t0.826\\nA260/A280\\t1.609\\nng/ µL\\t12\\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after clean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).

The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which came out to be 28.1 ng/ µL with 1.598 (A260/A280) and 1.143 (A260/A230).

The plan involved isolating the genomic DNA and plasmid DNA, performing restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, and transformation into a competent E. coli strain (Mach1) to select for successful insertion of the rspL gene conferring streptomycin resistance.\\n\\nThe first step was to isolate the genomic DNA from the E. coli Top10 strain and the plasmid DNA from the pUC19 vector. The concentrations of the isolated DNA were determined using a SimpliNano spectrophotometer. The genomic DNA had a concentration of 33.2 ng/\\u03bcL, while the pUC19 plasmid DNA had a concentration of 17.2 ng/\\u03bcL.\\n\\nThe next step was to perform restriction enzyme digestion on the genomic DNA and plasmid DNA. The original plan was to use the HindIII enzyme, but the decision was made to use BamHI instead to check if it would show similar digestion results as with the K12 strain of E. coli. The digestion reactions were set up and incubated, but when the samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, no bands were visible. This suggested that the DNA concentrations were too low for the RedSafe dye to detect.\\n\\nTo address the low DNA concentrations, a DNA clean-up step was performed on the genomic DNA using a GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA Clean-up Kit. However, this resulted in a significant loss of DNA, with the concentration dropping from 33.2 ng/\\u03bcL to only 12 ng/\\u03bcL. A new batch of genomic DNA was provided by the lab instructor, and this new DNA had a higher concentration of 28.1 ng/\\u03bcL. This new genomic DNA was cleaned up using the same kit, and the concentration increased to 109.6 ng/\\u03bcL.\\n\\nThe digestion reactions were set up again using the cleaned-up genomic DNA and the pUC19 plasmid DNA. Gel electrophoresis was performed, and the results showed a large smear for the digested genomic DNA, indicating that the BamHI enzyme was able to cut the DNA. The digested pUC19 plasmid also showed two faint bands, suggesting that the digestion was successful.\\n\\nTo further confirm the presence of the rspL gene, a third gel electrophoresis was performed using both BamHI and HindIII enzymes. The results showed a large smear for the digested genomic DNA, indicating that the enzymes were able to cut the DNA. The digested pUC19 plasmid also showed two distinct bands, confirming the successful digestion.\\n\\nThe next step was to perform the ligation reaction using the digested genomic DNA and the digested pUC19 plasmid. A 1:1 ratio of insert (genomic DNA) to vector (pUC19) was used, along with T4 ligase and PEG4000. The ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4\\u00b0C and then heat-inactivated.\\n\\nThe ligated product was then transformed into chemically competent Mach1 E. coli cells. Both positive and negative controls were included, and the experimental transformation was performed in duplicate. The transformed cells were plated on ampicillin/X-gal/IPTG plates to select for successful transformants.\\n\\nThe first transformation attempt was unsuccessful, as the positive control plate showed contamination. A second transformation was performed, but the results were still not satisfactory, as there was an inefficient uptake of the DNA by the host organism, leading to unsuccessful transformation.\\n\\nOverall, the project encountered several challenges, including low DNA concentrations, loss of DNA during the clean-up step, and issues with the transformation process. The use of BamHI instead of the originally planned HindIII enzyme was a strategic decision to investigate the digestion pattern, and the subsequent use of both BamHI and HindIII enzymes helped confirm the presence of the rspL gene in the genomic DNA.\\n\\nThe detailed documentation of the troubleshooting steps and the changes made throughout the project provide valuable insights into the challenges faced in creating a genomic library and the importance of adapting the experimental plan based on the results obtained. The use of various analytical tools, such as the restriction analyzer, also contributed to a better understanding of the DNA sequences and the cutting patterns of the enzymes used.\\n\\nDespite the challenges, the project demonstrates the importance of careful planning, thorough documentation, and the ability to troubleshoot and adapt the experimental approach to achieve the desired outcomes. The experience gained through this project can be valuable for future endeavors in the field of molecular biology and genetic engineering.\",\n",

This suggested that the DNA concentrations were too low for the RedSafe dye to detect.\\n\\nTo address the low DNA concentrations, a DNA clean-up step was performed on the genomic DNA using a GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA Clean-up Kit. However, this resulted in a significant loss of DNA, with the concentration dropping from 33.2 ng/μL to only 12 ng/μL. A new batch of genomic DNA was provided by the lab instructor, and this new DNA had a higher concentration of 28.1 ng/μL. This new genomic DNA was cleaned up using the same kit, and the concentration increased to 109.6 ng/μL.\\n\\nThe digestion reactions were set up again using the cleaned-up genomic DNA and the pUC19 plasmid DNA. Gel electrophoresis was performed, and the results showed a large smear for the digested genomic DNA, indicating that the BamHI enzyme was able to cut the DNA. The digested pUC19 plasmid also showed two faint bands, suggesting that the digestion was successful.\\n\\nTo further confirm the presence of the rspL gene, a third gel electrophoresis was performed using both BamHI and HindIII enzymes. The results showed a large smear for the digested genomic DNA, indicating that the enzymes were able to cut the DNA. The digested pUC19 plasmid also showed two distinct bands, confirming the successful digestion.\\n\\nThe next step was to perform the ligation reaction using the digested genomic DNA and the digested pUC19 plasmid. A 1:1 ratio of insert (genomic DNA) to vector (pUC19) was used, along with T4 ligase and PEG4000. The ligation reaction was incubated overnight at 4°C and then heat-inactivated.\\n\\nThe ligated product was then transformed into chemically competent Mach1 E. coli cells. Both positive and negative controls were included, and the experimental transformation was performed in duplicate. The transformed cells were plated on ampicillin/X-gal/IPTG plates to select for successful transformants.\\n\\nThe first transformation attempt was unsuccessful, as the positive control plate showed contamination. A second transformation was performed, but the results were still not satisfactory, as there was an inefficient uptake of the DNA by the host organism, leading to unsuccessful transformation.\\n\\nOverall, the project encountered several challenges, including low DNA concentrations, loss of DNA during the clean-up step, and issues with the transformation process. The use of BamHI instead of the originally planned HindIII enzyme was a strategic decision to investigate the digestion pattern, and the subsequent use of both BamHI and HindIII enzymes helped confirm the presence of the rspL gene in the genomic DNA.\\n\\nThe detailed documentation of the troubleshooting steps and the changes made throughout the project provide valuable insights into the challenges faced in creating a genomic library and the importance of adapting the experimental plan based on the results obtained. The use of various analytical tools, such as the restriction analyzer, also contributed to a better understanding of the DNA sequences and the cutting patterns of the enzymes used.\\n\\nDespite the challenges, the project demonstrates the importance of careful planning, thorough documentation, and the ability to troubleshoot and adapt the experimental approach to achieve the desired outcomes. The experience gained through this project can be valuable for future endeavors in the field of molecular biology and genetic engineering.', 'time_sec': 10.612772941589355}\n",

The ultimate goal was to confirm the successful insertion of the rspL gene, which confers streptomycin resistance, into the recipient *E. coli* strain Mach1. This discussion will analyze the methods, results, and troubleshooting steps taken throughout the experiment.\\n\\n#### Isolation of Genomic and Plasmid DNA\\n\\nThe initial step involved isolating genomic DNA from *E. coli* Top10 and plasmid DNA from pUC19 using GeneJET genomic DNA purification and plasmid mini prep kits, respectively. The concentrations of the isolated DNA were determined using SimpliNano, with the genomic DNA showing a concentration of 33.2 ng/\\u00b5L and the plasmid DNA at 17.2 ng/\\u00b5L. The A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios indicated relatively pure DNA, although the A260/A230 ratio for the plasmid DNA was slightly lower than ideal, suggesting some contamination.\\n\\n#### Restriction Enzyme Digestion\\n\\nInitially, HindIII was proposed for the restriction enzyme digestion, but BamHI was used instead to see if it would yield similar results as with the K12 strain. The digestion reactions were set up and incubated, followed by gel electrophoresis to confirm the digestion. However, the first gel electrophoresis showed no visible bands, indicating that the concentration of the genomic DNA was too low for effective visualization with INtRON RedSafeTM, which requires a minimum concentration of 50 ng/\\u00b5L.\\n\\n#### DNA Clean-Up and Re-Digestion\\n\\nTo address the issue of low DNA concentration, a DNA clean-up was performed using the Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA Clean-Up Kit. However, the initial clean-up resulted in a significant loss of DNA, with the concentration dropping to 12 ng/\\u00b5L. Consequently, a new batch of genomic DNA was provided by the lab instructor, which was then cleaned up, resulting in a much higher concentration of 109.6 ng/\\u00b5L.\\n\\nWith the new, higher concentration DNA, another digestion reaction was set up and analyzed via gel electrophoresis. This time, the gel showed a large uncut band for the genomic DNA and a smear for the digested genomic DNA, indicating successful digestion. The digested plasmid also showed faint bands, suggesting partial digestion.\\n\\n#### Ligation and Transformation\\n\\nThe digested genomic DNA and plasmid were then ligated using T4 ligase in a 1:1 ratio. The ligation product was transformed into Mach1 competent cells, and the transformation reactions were plated on Ampicillin/X-gal/IPTG plates. The first transformation attempt failed due to contamination in the positive control, as indicated by the presence of large white colonies. A second transformation attempt also failed, likely due to inefficient DNA uptake by the host cells.\\n\\n#### Further Analysis and Troubleshooting\\n\\nTo further troubleshoot, a third gel electrophoresis was performed using both HindIII and BamHI. The gel showed distinct bands for the digested genomic DNA and plasmid, confirming the action of both enzymes. The restriction analysis indicated that BamHI cuts at two sites on the genomic DNA (positions 180 and 2865), resulting in large fragments, while HindIII cuts at position 4130. For the plasmid, BamHI cuts at position 662, and HindIII cuts at position 632, creating sticky ends that facilitate ligation.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nThe experiment faced several challenges, including low DNA concentration, contamination, and inefficient transformation. Despite these issues, the final gel electrophoresis confirmed the successful digestion of both the genomic DNA and plasmid with BamHI and HindIII. However, the transformation step needs further optimization to ensure efficient DNA uptake by the host cells.\\n\\nFuture steps could include optimizing the ligation reaction by adjusting the insert-to-vector ratio, increasing the amount of ligated product used for transformation, and improving the transformation efficiency by using electroporation instead of chemical transformation. Additionally, ensuring a sterile environment and proper handling techniques will help prevent contamination in future experiments.\\n\\nOverall, while the experiment did not achieve the final goal of confirming the insertion of the rspL gene, valuable insights were gained into the challenges and potential solutions for creating a genomic library using *E. coli* and pUC19 plasmid vectors.\",\n",

The digested plasmid also showed faint bands, suggesting partial digestion.\\n\\n#### Ligation and Transformation\\n\\nThe digested genomic DNA and plasmid were then ligated using T4 ligase in a 1:1 ratio. The ligation product was transformed into Mach1 competent cells, and the transformation reactions were plated on Ampicillin/X-gal/IPTG plates. The first transformation attempt failed due to contamination in the positive control, as indicated by the presence of large white colonies. A second transformation attempt also failed, likely due to inefficient DNA uptake by the host cells.\\n\\n#### Further Analysis and Troubleshooting\\n\\nTo further troubleshoot, a third gel electrophoresis was performed using both HindIII and BamHI. The gel showed distinct bands for the digested genomic DNA and plasmid, confirming the action of both enzymes. The restriction analysis indicated that BamHI cuts at two sites on the genomic DNA (positions 180 and 2865), resulting in large fragments, while HindIII cuts at position 4130. For the plasmid, BamHI cuts at position 662, and HindIII cuts at position 632, creating sticky ends that facilitate ligation.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nThe experiment faced several challenges, including low DNA concentration, contamination, and inefficient transformation. Despite these issues, the final gel electrophoresis confirmed the successful digestion of both the genomic DNA and plasmid with BamHI and HindIII. However, the transformation step needs further optimization to ensure efficient DNA uptake by the host cells.\\n\\nFuture steps could include optimizing the ligation reaction by adjusting the insert-to-vector ratio, increasing the amount of ligated product used for transformation, and improving the transformation efficiency by using electroporation instead of chemical transformation. Additionally, ensuring a sterile environment and proper handling techniques will help prevent contamination in future experiments.\\n\\nOverall, while the experiment did not achieve the final goal of confirming the insertion of the rspL gene, valuable insights were gained into the challenges and potential solutions for creating a genomic library using *E. coli* and pUC19 plasmid vectors.', 'time_sec': 18.40669274330139}\n",
